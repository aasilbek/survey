# Survey project 

## Task

Design and develop an API for a user polling system.

## Functionality for the system administrator

- authorization in the system (registration is not required)
- add / change / polls. Poll attributes: title, start date, end date, description. After creation, the field "start date" for the survey cannot be changed
- adding / changing / questions in the survey. Question attributes: question text, question type (answer text, single choice answer, multiple choice answer)

## Functionality for system users

- getting a list of active polls
- taking a survey: surveys can be completed anonymously, a numeric ID is passed to the API as a user identifier, by which the user's answers to questions are stored; one user can participate in any number of surveys
- getting the polls completed by the user with details on the answers (what is selected) by the unique user ID
